Overview
This page is an e-commerce app, built from scratch using React, Node.js, Express and tested with Jest. This app dynamically renders a product page using data from an API. Each page has 3 main components. The first is a detailed product overview with images and information about available styles, sizes and stock. After that are 2 carousels of cards, the first is a series of products deemed related to the main product, and the second is a user generated list of products that is saved in session storage. Finally there is a reviews section, where you can see all the reviews for a product, as well as aggregated review data like average ratings, and where you can also write your own reviews.
